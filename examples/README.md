# Examples

## Viewing on `sycamore-rs.netlify.app`

All the examples are hosted under `examples.sycamore.dev/<example_name>` with
`<example_name>` being the name of the example you want to view. For instance, the `todomvc` example
is hosted on
[`examples.sycamore.dev/todomvc`](https://examples.sycamore.dev/todomvc).

## Building Locally

All the examples can also be built locally using [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev). For instance, the
following command builds and serves the `todomvc` example:

```bash
cd examples/todomvc
trunk serve
```

Now open up `localhost:8080` in your browser to see "Hello World!".
